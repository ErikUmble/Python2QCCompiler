    "## Database Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will go over how to create a quantum Benchmark using the `BaseProblem`, `BaseTrial` types, with `BenchmarkDatabase` as a database manager class. \n",
    "The idea behind these types is to create a standard interface for interacting with benchmarks of different trials, and core logic for manipulating DBs and result fetching can all be modified in a single place. \n",
    "As a user of these types, your responsibility is to define classes that meet the spec of `BaseProblem` and `BaseTrial`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQLAlchemy\n",
    "We use SQLAlchemy for an object relational mapper (ORM) so as to map our Python objects to database tables; to have easy table updates (migrations); and to support type-intelligent database queries, built in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows how to define columns for an SQLAlchemy table. If you modify such tables later, see `migrations.md` for documentation on how to migrate the database to sync those changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3SAT\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build our own Benchmark for the 3SAT problem. Recall that 3SAT is defined as the \"Product of Sums\" of boolean values, i.e. (x1 + x2 + x3)(x1 + ~x2 + x4) where + is done modulo 2. \n",
    "We will represent this problem as a `List[List[Int]]` where the sign of the int is inversion (not). \n",
    "\n",
    "We need to inherit from the `BaseProblem` class and fill out the methods `to_dict`, `from_dict`, `problem_type`, `get_problem_size`, `number_of_input_bits`, and `oracle`. The first four are critical for storange in the database, and the latter is critical to running the benchmark. We will use a prepared oracle synthesis method but the idea is to allow for customization of different oracle synthesis methods. "
